## How to Use HCloud

1. **Launch HCloud:**  
   Follow the installation steps for your OS. When HCloud starts, you'll see a simple GUI.

2. **Enter Your Hetzner API Key:**  
   When prompted, paste your Hetzner Cloud API key. If you don’t have one, follow these steps:

   **Creating a Hetzner API Key:**
   - **Log in to Hetzner Cloud:**  
     Visit the [Hetzner Cloud Console](https://console.hetzner.cloud) and sign in.
   - **Navigate to API Settings:**  
     Click **Security > API Tokens** in the left-hand menu.
   - **Generate a New API Key:**
     - Click **Generate API Token**.
     - Enter a name (e.g., "HCloud GUI") and select **Read/Write permissions**.
     - Click **Generate Token**.
   - **Copy Your API Key:**  
     Since the key is shown only once, copy it now and paste it into HCloud.

3. **Manage Your Cloud Resources:**

   ### Create Server Tab
   - **Create New Servers:**  
     Enter a server name, select a location and distribution.  
     HCloud auto-fills firewall and SSH key names if you leave them blank.
   - **Firewall Management:**  
     You’ll be prompted to add your Home IP for extra security. (This helps prevent unauthorized access.)
   - **SSH Key Management:**  
     Import or create new SSH key pairs directly within HCloud.  
     You’ll be asked to set a passphrase for new keys—be sure to document it carefully!
     
   ### Install nodectl Tab
   - **Select Server & Network:**  
     Your server details and network selection are auto-populated after server creation.
   - **Node Username:**  
     Defaults to `nodeadmin` (change if needed, but remember it).
   - **nodectl Version:**  
     Make sure you install the correct nodectl version (check your Discord chat for details).
   - **Additional Options:**  
     - **Import P12 File (Optional):** Import your P12 file if you are rebuilding a node.
     - **Desktop Shortcuts:** On Windows, you can choose to create SSH/SFTP shortcuts; on macOS/Linux, aliases may be created.
     - **Export to PuTTY:** (Windows Only) If you have PuTTY and WinSCP installed, HCloud can export server settings to PuTTY.
